# Code-For-ICRD
This is the code repo of the paper entitled "Comprehensive Investigation and Isolation have Effectively Suppressed the Spread of COVID-19"
## Data fold
There are two Excel files this this fold:
1. ncovData.xlsx saves the data collected from NHC. The sheet of "China" saves the data we used in this paper.
2. Results.xlsx saves the results generated by ICRD and SEIR, which is used for plotting.

## Code
### MatLab
1. mymodel.m is the code file of ICRD model, which includes both S-ICRD and D-ICRD.
2. seir.m is the code file of SEIR model.
3. main.m is used for reading the data.
4. Test.m is the enter to simulate our model
### Python
1. Plot.py is used for plotting the figures in our paper.
